## üõ†Ô∏è How It Was Built

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Removed irrelevant columns (e.g., `homepage`, `tagline`, `keywords`).  
   - Parsed JSON-like strings (e.g., `genres`) into usable lists.  
   - Fixed data types for memory efficiency (`int32`, `float32`, `string`, `category`).  

2. **Missing Data Handling**  
   - Filled `overview` with `"No description available"`.  
   - Imputed `genres` using **keyword-based matching** on `overview` as a robust fallback.  

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Added `weighted_rating` for balanced quality scoring.  
   - Created `combined_text` for content-based filtering.  
   - Engineered contextual features: `movie_age`, `genre_count`, `is_cold_start`, etc.  

4. **Optimization**  
   - Reduced memory usage by over 40% with efficient data types.  
   - Saved the final dataset in **Parquet format** for fast loading.
